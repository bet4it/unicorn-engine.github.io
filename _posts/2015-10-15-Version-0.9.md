We are very excited to announce the first public release, version 0.9, of Unicorn Engine!

The source code & precompiled binaries are available in the [download](/download/) section. See [documentation](/docs/) for how to compile and install Unicorn.

A quick tutorial on how to program with Unicorn in C & Python can be found [here](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/docs/tutorial.html).

We would like show our gratitude to the beta testers for bug reports & code contributions during the beta phase! Their invaluable helps have been tremendous for us to keep this far.

Unicorn aims to lay the ground for innovative works. We look forward to seeing many advanced research & development in the security area built on this engine. Let the fun begin!
