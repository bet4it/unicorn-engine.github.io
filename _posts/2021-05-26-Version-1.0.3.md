We are very happy to announce version **1.0.3** of Unicorn Engine!

This version fixes some minor issues of v1.0.2 in the core and some bindings. We also added a new binding in Rust. See the [ChangeLog](/changelog/) for more details.

The source code & precompiled binaries are available in the [Download](/download/) section. See [Documentation](/docs/) for how to compile and install Unicorn.

We also wish to express our sincere gratitude to all contributors, who generously supported us to maintain Unicorn project!

What is next now? Let us look forward to the next major update: [Unicorn 2](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/1217). Please [contact](/contact) if you want to support our work.
