We are very happy to announce version **1.0.2** of Unicorn Engine!

It has been more than 3.5 years since the last major update, and this version marks 5 year of Unicorn. Such a long journey for an open source project! That is really exciting to see our magical animal having more and more impact in both academia community and the cybersecurity industry.

This version fixes various issues of v1.0.1, adds some new API and introduces more bindings. See the [ChangeLog](/changelog/) for more details.

The source code & precompiled binaries are available in the [Download](/download/) section. See [Documentation](/docs/) for how to compile and install Unicorn.

In no particular order, we would like to thank [CatenaCyber](https://catenacyber.fr), [Grayshift](https://www.grayshift.com) and [Google Patch Rewards](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/) for sponsoring this release!

We also wish to express our sincere gratitude to all contributors, who generously supported us to maintain Unicorn project!

What is next now? Let us look forward to the next major update: [Unicorn 2](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/1217). Please [contact](/contact) if you want to support our work.
