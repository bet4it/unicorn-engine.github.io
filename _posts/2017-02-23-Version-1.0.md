We are very happy to announce version 1.0 of Unicorn Engine!

The source code & precompiled binaries are available in the [download](/download/) section. See [documentation](/docs/) for how to compile and install Unicorn.

A quick tutorial on how to program with Unicorn in C & Python can be found [here](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/docs/tutorial.html).

Important changes since v0.9 include:

- Lots of bugfixes in all architectures.
- Fix many memory leaking issues.
- New APIs: *uc\_query*, *uc\_reg\_write\_batch*, *uc\_reg\_read\_batch*, *uc\_mem\_map\_ptr*, *uc\_mem\_regions*, *uc\_free*, *uc\_context\_alloc*, *uc\_context\_save* & *uc\_context\_restore*.
- New memory hook type: *UC\_HOOK\_MEM\_READ\_AFTER*.
- Add new version macros *UC\_VERSION\_MAJOR*, *UC\_VERSION\_MINOR*, *UC\_VERSION\_EXTRA*.
- Remove glib & pkconfig dependency.
- Windows: export a static lib that can be used outside of Mingw.
- ARM:
    - Support MCLASS cpu (Cortex-M3).
    - Better support for Thumb mode.
    - *uc\_reg\_write* now can modify CPSR register.
    - Add some ARM coproc registers.
- ARM64: *uc\_reg\_read* & *uc\_reg\_write* now handles W0-W31 registers.
- X86:
    - Fix 16bit address computation.
    - Fix initial state of segment registers.
- Windows: fix a double free bug in *uc\_close*.
- 3 new bindings: Haskell, MSVC, VB6.
- Python:
    - Better support for Python3
    - Fix memory leaking that prevents UC instances from being GC.

Community also provide independent bindings for [Pascal](https://github.com/stievie/UnicornPascal), [Rust](https://github.com/ekse/unicorn-rs) & [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/UnicornEngine).

Huge thanks to all the heroic contributors who worked hard for over 1 year to make this release possible!
