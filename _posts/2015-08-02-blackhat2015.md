We are working to release more contents & prepare for our [BlackHat USA 2015 talk](https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#unicorn-next-generation-cpu-emulator-framework). Meanwhile, check out a sample code in [Python](http://dpaste.com/0533J4M) and [C language](http://dpaste.com/225EPFT) to see how Unicorn can be useful for a real problem.

Our presentation at BlackHat USA will be on August 5th, 10:20 - 11:10, in room "South Seas IJ".

See you there with some cool Unicorn stickers, soon!
