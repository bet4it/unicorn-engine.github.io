We are very excited to announce Unicorn2 **beta** to the public!

Unicorn engine was first introduced at [Blackhat USA 2015](/blackhat2015) as the only cross-platform-architecture framework for CPU emulation. After its release, Unicorn made some good impact in the security community and quickly established itself as the foundation of [various innovative work](/showcase). More than 6 years passed, it is time to make a major step forward with Unicorn2!

Based on Qemu 5, we built Unicorn2 from scratch, with a lot of optimization on performance & code size. While still maintaining backward compatibility with the current version, Unicorn2 supports the latest instruction set of all important CPU architectures, including X86, Arm, Aarch64, Mips, Sparc & M68k. Going further, we also added 2 highly-demanded architectures in **PowerPC** & **RISCV**.

The source code of Unicorn2 is now available at [dev branch](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/tree/dev) on our Github repo. Check out [COMPILE.md](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/blob/dev/docs/COMPILE.md) for how to compile and install Unicorn2.

Since this important milestone deserves it, we also designed a new logo for Unicorn, as you can see at the top of this post!

What is next now? Help us to fix bugs, update [bindings](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/tree/dev/bindings) so we can officially release Unicorn v2.0.
